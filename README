Overview of goals (in no particular order at the moment)
    	X   1.  Make a plan
	X   2.  Demonstrate 2 frequency data record as shown in TDOA paper
	    3.  Demonstrate reception of satellite transponder signal
	    4.  Figure out how many ground stations are required and where they should be located
	~   5.  Figure out how to configure remote access of the ground stations
	~   6.  Demonstrate locating of ground based signals using multiple ground stations
	    7.  Figure out how to embed processing capability or a way to do it that doesn’t involve running matlab
	    8.  Demonstrate embedded capability using ground based signals 
	    9.  Deploy ground stations and locate satellites
	    10. Incorporate satellite position measurements into kalman filter estimator
            11. Characterize errors and incorporate covariance into estimate

Satellite contact CONOPS
    1.  Plan satellite observation
	2.  Satellite crosses elevation mask
	3.  Ground station begins observations
		a.  Start on reference frequency
		    i.  Collect min number of samples
		b.  Switch to satellite transponder frequency
			i.  Collect min number of samples
		c.  Switch to reference frequency
			i.  Collect min number of samples
	4.  (IOD requires 3 observations so we’ll divide up the anticipated contact period into 3)
	5.  Repeat observation 3 times during contact assuming some minimum contact duration
    6.  Measurements fed into kalman filter estimator
